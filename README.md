# Trivia-Game

In this assignment, we were required to create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

Getting Started 

Name That Country- Trivia

Instructions:

Click Start to begin the trivia. You have 30 seconds to answer each question and a counter will be displayed to show how much time is reamining. The answer to each question is displayed afterwards whether you selected the correct answer, the incorrect answer or if no answer is selected before time ran out. If no answer is selected before the timer runs out, the trivia will advance to the next question. At the end of the game, you will be shown the number of correct answers, the number of incorrect answers and any questions that went unanswered.
